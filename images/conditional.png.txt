# Placeholder for conditional.png icon
# 
# This should be replaced with an actual PNG icon file (16x16 or 24x24 pixels)
# representing conditional restrictions (e.g., a clock with a prohibition sign)
#
# You can create this icon using any graphics editor or find an appropriate
# icon from an open icon set like:
# - Material Design Icons
# - Font Awesome 
# - OpenStreetMap icons
#
# The icon should visually represent time-based or conditional access rules.
